Policy Translator Platform
 Problem Statement
Government policies and welfare schemes are often written in complex language, making them difficult for common people to understand and access. This leads to low awareness, confusion, and missed benefits.
 Our Solution
Our platform simplifies government policies into clear, easy-to-understand language so that people can:
Understand policies without legal or technical jargon
Identify which category they belong to
Know what benefits they are eligible for
Access information in a structured and trustworthy way
The platform focuses on clarity, credibility, and accessibility.
Key Features
Categorized policy display based on user type (students, workers, farmers, etc.)
Fixed and verified list of laws/policies to maintain credibility
Simple explanations instead of complex government language
Clean and user-friendly interface
No unnecessary searching — users explore via categories
Designed for easy future upgrades (AI engine planned)

Tech Stack
React 19: The latest version of React is used for building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
Vite: A lightning-fast build tool and development server that provides an extremely smooth development experience.
Vanilla CSS: No heavy CSS frameworks like Tailwind were used. Instead, we used Modern CSS with Variables (variables.css) to create a custom design system with consistent spacing, colors (glassmorphism), and animations.
